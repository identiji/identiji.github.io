<p id="text08"><strong>Q: Why was Beta launched as a web app? I thought you were going to make a browser extension first.</strong></p>
<br>
<p id="text08">A: In a previous survey, most of you expressed interest in using Identiji on a mobile browser (rather than a just desktop one).</p>
<br>
<p id="text08">By making Identiji available as a web app, we are able to let a larger number of users access the Identiji service right away, without having to install extra plugins or extensions â€” which usually only end up working on one platform but not the other, and can therefore be an inconvenience.</p>
<br>
<p id="text08">We understand that having to open Identiji.com everytime you need to enter a password may not be ideal for everyone, so we may still consider releasing a browser extension in the future.</p>

<p id="text08"><strong>Q: I am a web developer. Can I integrate Identiji onto my site?</strong></p>
<br>
<p id="text08">A: Quite possibly in the near future.</p>
<br>
<p id="text08">Since Day 1, we have been contemplating releasing a developers' tool version of Identiji. That way more third-party websites out there can have native support of emoji passwords that are web-friendly.</p>
<br>
<p id="text08">Now that the web app beta is in a stable stage, we might start working on the dev tool soon.</p>
<br>
<p id="text08">And when that happens, we will most likely open source the code, too.</p>
